                <p>
                    A controller is an input device, or peripheral, used to control a video game. A controller is
                    typically connected to an arcade, game console, or personal computer and can be a keyboard, mouse,
                    gamepad, electronic joystick, paddle, or any gaming-specific device capable of receiving commands.
                    Some special devices like steering wheels or guns can be used in racing or shooting games. Some
                    devices like keyboards and mice are, in fact, generic input devices and their use is not limited to
                    gaming.

                <h1>First PlayStation Controller (Model SCPH-1010)</h1>
                <div class="imagem1"><img src="imagens/primeirocontrole.png"></div>
                <p>
                    The first PlayStation controller emerged in 1994, alongside the launch of Sony's first console.
                    Initially designed for Nintendo, the controller closely resembled that of the Super Nintendo, but
                    with a slightly different aesthetic and the addition of two more buttons, R and L. It also had a
                    larger design, making it easier to grip, and served as the foundation for Sony's controller shapes
                    to this day, evolving over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An interesting curiosity about the first controller was regarding its buttons, which didn't feature
                    letters but symbols. According to a Sony engineer, these symbols were not random. The triangle
                    represented a viewpoint, indicating something pointing in a direction. The square represented a
                    piece of paper, like a menu or document. The X and circle buttons represented No and Yes,
                    respectively. Although these representations may not make as much sense in today's controllers, the
                    symbols have endured and become an iconic part of the console.

                <h1>Dual Analog</h1>
                <div class="imagem2"><img src="imagens/segundocontrole.png"></div>
                <p>
                    One of the significant advancements that came with games on consoles like the PlayStation was the
                    introduction of more modern 3D games with better quality. As a result, the directional arrows became
                    somewhat limited and didn't allow for fluid character movement, especially in fighting or racing
                    games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why Sony initially released the Dual Analog controller, which was the first controller to
                    feature analog thumbsticks. It hit the market in 1997.
                    In Japan, the new version of the controller even came with a vibration feature, but in the United
                    States and Europe, it did not include this addition. To give players the choice, it still came with
                    the ANALOG button, which allowed users to activate or deactivate the analog thumbsticks for those
                    who preferred the standard directional buttons or games that worked better with them.

                <h1>DualShock</h1>
                <p>
                    The DualShock emerged as an upgrade to the Dual Analog, as it introduced vibration feedback for all
                    markets. The DualShock controller featured significant aesthetic improvements, making the analog
                    thumbsticks more comfortable with rubberized surfaces that lacked the small cavities present in the
                    previous model. Another change was that these thumbsticks became "clickable," leading to the
                    introduction of the R3 and L3 buttons when pressed. The controller gained widespread popularity and
                    became the primary model, enduring through various generations of consoles that would come in the
                    future.

                <h1>DualShock 2</h1>
                <div class="imagem3"><img src="imagens/quartocontrole.png"></div>
                <p class="img4p">
                    Due to the immense success of the DualShock, the PlayStation introduced the model number 2, with
                    several changes. The DualShock 2 now came in black as the standard color, offering more options for
                    users.
                    The most significant innovation was that, except for the Start, Select, R3, L3, and Analog buttons,
                    all the others gained pressure sensitivity. This meant that in certain games, you could better
                    control an action depending on the pressure applied to a button. For example, in GTA San Andreas,
                    the character would pedal faster or slower depending on how hard the button was pressed.

                <h1>Sixaxis and eventually DualShock 3</h1>
                <p>
                    With the arrival of the PlayStation 3 in 2006, the new controller also came with innovations, and
                    the main one, initially, was the name. Due to legal issues and a patent infringement lawsuit, Sony
                    ended up releasing the controller with a new name and without the vibration function.
                    In practical terms, the Sixaxis introduced technology that gave it its name. It stands for "six
                    axes," and in practice, it could detect when the controller was physically tilted. This means it had
                    motion sensors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, it also featured wireless technology, allowing you to connect the controller via
                    Bluetooth, and it had a rechargeable internal battery via a USB connector. The new Sixaxis also had
                    four small LEDs on the top that indicated the player order. The L2 and R2 buttons became more
                    responsive to pressure.
                    In the following year, 2007, Sony finally reached a legal agreement and was able to release its
                    controller under the brand name, DualShock 3. It was virtually the same as the Sixaxis but with
                    vibration functionality and additional color options.

                <h1>DualShock 4 and the arrival of the screen on the controller</h1>
                <div class="imagem4"><img src="imagens/sextocontrole.png"></div>
                <p>
                    The PlayStation 4 was released in 2013, and with it, the latest version of the DualShock controller.
                    The DualShock 4 already stood out for its front-facing screen and came with several other
                    innovations. Its appearance was more modern, but it still retained much of the classic accessory's
                    design.
                    Among the new features was the light bar at the top that had various functions within games (such
                    as, for example, displaying the character's health in God of War).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The controller also came with a speaker and the option to connect headphones for an enhanced gaming
                    experience.
                    Regarding the touchpad, it was touch-sensitive and could even be used as an additional button. In
                    order to accommodate it, they removed the Start and Select buttons and added the new Option button
                    (which actually serves as a Start button as well) and the Share button for sharing screenshots.
                    The analog sticks also underwent a visual change, gaining edges and returning to a grip with a small
                    cavity, similar to the original Dual Analog.

                <h1>DualSense, voted the best controller of all time</h1>
                <div class="imagem5"><img src="imagens/setimocontrole.png"></div>
                <p>
                    With the arrival of the new PlayStation 5, Sony decided to introduce a new line of controllers as
                    well, this time called the DualSense. It was so successful that it was considered the best
                    controller of all time at the time of its release, bringing various changes and improvements
                    compared to the DualShock.
                    One of the major innovations of the DualSense was the haptic feedback triggers, which provide
                    physical feedback to players when using them. For instance, if the character is pulling a bowstring,
                    it will vibrate and, depending on the difficulty, become harder to press.
                    It also has the ability to sense breath through the built-in microphone. It allows players to
                    communicate during matches without needing a headset and even provides the option to mute the
                    microphone if desired.
